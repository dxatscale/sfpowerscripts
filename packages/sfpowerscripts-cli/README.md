A build system for package based development in Salesforce, delivered as a node cli that can be implemented in any CI/CD system of choice.Read more about the cli and details here - https://docs.flxblio.io

#### Features

- Features an Orchestrator, which utilizes sfdx-project.json as the source of truth for driving the build system, ensuring very low maintenance on programs often dealing with multiple number of packages
- Builds packages in parallel by respecting dependencies
- Ability to selectively build changed packages in a mono repo
- Ability to deploy only packages that are changed in repo
- Pooling commands to prepare a pool of scratch org's with packages pre installed for optimized Pull/Merge Request validation
- Artifacts Driven, all create commands produce an artifact or operate on an artifact
- Integrate with any CI/CD system of choice
- All commands are enabled with statsD, for collecting metrics about your pipeline.

There are lot more features to explore. Read more at https://docs.flxblio.io

The project is delivered as a <b>CLI</b> that can be deployed in any CI/CD system, The module is available in [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flxblio/sfp) or can be
used by using the [docker image](https://github.com/flxblio/sfp/pkgs/container/sfp)





#### Motivation

- Need for artifact driven build system for package based development models especially on complex and large programs

- Providing additional functionality that is either not supported by the sfdx-cli, such as data packages or automatically understanding tests in a given package

- Ease of use, one should not be spending too much time scripting a pipeline.
